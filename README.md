# AleccaBot

AleccaBot is a personal Telegram bot designed to serve as a collection of functions aimed at simplifying your life. 
This bot is easily extensible with new features, and its structure can be used as a foundation for any bot created using BotFather.


MODULES:
1) assicurazione: COMPLETED (/release/v1.0)
2) personal-cloud: WIP (/dev/cloud/photo)
3) room-cam: NOT YET STARTED

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
1) I'd like to move bot commands inside module folders, instead than having a unique big TelegramBot.py file containing everything.
   I don't know how to do it yet, but this should be done somehow, sooner or later, in order to have a clean bot with easily and
   truly attachable isolated modules.

Release v1.0 has a bug with /hello message


This README file will be gradually enriched with a detailed description of how to use the bot.
